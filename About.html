                    I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my life, cooking dinner usually meant microwaving a 
                    frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t until I setteled down, that
                    I started cooking real food . I started realizing that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. 
                    And gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!<br>
                <p class="text-indent">Recipes by Mitesh - It’s a food website, so naturally you’re going to find recipes here. But I only share the 
                   recipes I really, truly love. Step-by-step instructions. When I first started cooking, I was unsure about so many 
                   things like: How big should I dice the onions? ; How thick should I cut the vegetables? ; What should this look like
                   halfway through the recipe when it looks NOTHING like the final photo? . I love learning any skill that helps me get 
                   the job done faster, easier or with a better result. Sometimes cooking just doesn’t go as planned but don’t let that 
                   discourage you, though. Learn from the mistakes and laugh along with me. It’s just food…if it doesn’t turn out good,
                   toss the rest and just try again next time. Fun! Food and fun come together as everything about food should be 
                   fun: eating it, making it and even making a mess of it.</p>
                   Now, let’s go have some fun in the kitchen!
